My project is _Identify the effcts of weather condition on the bike sharing system_, using an open source London public tranportation dataset containing 10 variables and 17414 observations. Measures including descriptive analysis, heatmapping, boxplotting, trend panalysis, regression analysis were applied. In my final outcome, the variable of weather code plays as a covariant variable in examining the biking usage rate.

#### exam1 - DA101
DA101 is a 45-minute exam that assesses your proficiency in data management, exploratory analysis, and statistical experimentation using SQL. To successfully pass this exam, you should be able to:
- Perform data extraction, joining and aggregation tasks
- Perform cleaning tasks to prepare data for analysis
- Assess data quality and perform validation tasks
- Calculate metrics to effectively report characteristics of data and relationships between features
- Read, and analyze data visualizations to represent the relationships between features
- Describe statistical concepts that underpin hypothesis testing and experimentation
#### exam2 - DA201
DA201 is a 60-minute exam where you'll choose either R or Python to work through the questions. This exam assesses your abilities to use R or Python for data management, exploratory analysis, and statistical experimentation. To successfully pass this exam, you should be able to:
- Perform standard data extraction, joining and aggregation tasks
- Create data visualizations in Python or R to demonstrate the characteristics of data
- Create data visualizations in Python or R to represent the relationships between features
- Describe statistical concepts that underpin hypothesis testing and experimentation (i.e., statistical distributions, power analysis, parameter estimation and confidence intervals)
- The final stage of the certification required the individual to complete a practical exam. This stage of the certification is graded manually and stringently by our data scientist experts. The practical exam is split into two parts:
#### Practical exam
1. Technical report:
In the case of the technical report, the audience is a data science manager. It can be considered that the work is being presented to show how the task has been approached, why certain actions were taken, and how the work helps to solve the problem defined. There is no one right answer.

2. Non-technical presentation
The final stage was to adapt the information towards a non-technical audience. It is a common requirement for data analysts to have to present their work to others who have no background in data analytics. These audiences are interested in why the work was done and what the outcome was, typically not how it was done.

To pass the practical exam, you'll need to be able to:
Employ data visualization to support my findings
Describe how data can inform business decisions
Frame, convey, and summarize stories using data
Employ multiple tactics (written and verbal) to communicate to business leaders
